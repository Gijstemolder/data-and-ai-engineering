## Student Information

## Business Context
Describe the business or domain you're working with:
- Industry: Auditing
- Company/Organization: Real (accounting firm)
- Business Problem: Insights. After the implementation of Afas and Retain we don´t have the necessary and wanted insights. 

## Data Sources
List the data sources you plan to use:
1. **Primary Source**: ERP-system (Afas Profit, API)
2. **Secondary Source**: Resource planning tool (Retain, API) 
3. **Supporting Data**: None

## Project Objectives
What will your data pipeline accomplish?
- **Primary Goal**: For the primary goal I write down the goal of my company. Combine planned hours (Retain) with the actual written hours (Afas) to: (1) get insights in the actual project (can we foresee write-offs, problematic projects)
- **Secondary Goals**: Get insights in the differences between the planned hours and actual hours of t-1, so we can make a data driven planning next year based on actual hours. This would (1) improve our planning for next year and (2) give input for the budget negotiation with clients. 
- **Tertiary Goals**: In our file 
- **Success Metrics**: If the PowerBI has accurate data from both Afas and Retain it's a succes. If there is time left I'd like to try to experiment with an AI-agent to help with changes in the planning software or the gain additional insights. 

## Technical Approach
- **Data Ingestion**: API´s
- **Data Processing**: I still have to discover this. Currently I (we) don't know yet what we can expect. 
- **Data Storage**: Azure (most likely)
- **Analytics/ML**: PowerBI dashboard (most likely)

## Timeline
Plan your 12-week project timeline based on your chosen components:

- **Week 1-3**: Coordination with work about the project, write the project proposal and get the necessary rights to the relevant data.  
- **Week 4-6**: Data exploration (ingestion)
- **Week 7-9**: Data storage, transformation and serving
- **Week 10-12**: Data serving and deployment. Possibly AI-agent
